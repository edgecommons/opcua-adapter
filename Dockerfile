# Requires the edgecommons Java artifact resolvable from GitHub Packages Maven (com.mbreissi.edgecommons:edgecommons);
# see docs/platform/DESIGN-packaging.md §13. --enable-native-access is for the streaming FFM binding.
#
# Multi-stage build: stage 1 compiles the shaded, self-contained component jar with Maven against the
# PUBLISHED edgecommons artifact; stage 2 is a slim JRE that runs it as a non-root user. With
# --platform auto the library detects KUBERNETES, defaults config to CONFIGMAP and transport to MQTT,
# and resolves identity from the Downward API — so the container needs NO default args.
